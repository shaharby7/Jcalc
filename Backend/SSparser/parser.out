Unused terminals:

    R_PARENTHESIS

Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> sequence
Rule 1     sequence -> sequence throw
Rule 2     sequence -> throw
Rule 3     throw -> THROW

Terminals, with rules where they appear

L_PARENTHESIS        : 
R_PARENTHESIS        : 
THROW                : 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

sequence             : 1 0
throw                : 1 2

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . sequence
    (1) sequence -> . sequence throw
    (2) sequence -> . throw
    (3) throw -> . THROW

    THROW           shift and go to state 1

    throw                          shift and go to state 2
    sequence                       shift and go to state 3

state 1

    (3) throw -> THROW .

    THROW           reduce using rule 3 (throw -> THROW .)
    $end            reduce using rule 3 (throw -> THROW .)


state 2

    (2) sequence -> throw .

    THROW           reduce using rule 2 (sequence -> throw .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (sequence -> throw .)


state 3

    (0) S' -> sequence .
    (1) sequence -> sequence . throw
    (3) throw -> . THROW

    THROW           shift and go to state 1

    throw                          shift and go to state 4

state 4

    (1) sequence -> sequence throw .

    THROW           reduce using rule 1 (sequence -> sequence throw .)
    $end            reduce using rule 1 (sequence -> sequence throw .)
