Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> sequence
Rule 1     sequence -> sequence throw
Rule 2     sequence -> throw
Rule 3     throw -> THROW
Rule 4     throw -> L_PARENTHESIS sequence R_PARENTHESIS

Terminals, with rules where they appear

L_PARENTHESIS        : 4
R_PARENTHESIS        : 4
THROW                : 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

sequence             : 1 4 0
throw                : 1 2

Parsing method: LALR
